# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is designed to classify images into different categories, leveraging the powerful capabilities of CNNs to extract features and make accurate predictions.

## Project Structure

- `ImageClassification.pdf`: A detailed explanation of the concepts and methodologies used in this project, including image composition, normalization, and CNN architecture.

## Key Concepts

### Image Composition
An image is composed of pixels, each with an intensity value. In digital images, these values are often represented in three color channels: Red, Green, and Blue (RGB).

### Image Normalization
Normalization is a preprocessing step that adjusts the range of pixel intensity values to a common scale. This helps in making the input data more suitable for training neural networks.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are a class of deep learning neural networks designed specifically for processing structured grid data, such as images. They are capable of capturing spatial hierarchies in data through convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

#### Key Components of CNNs
- **Convolutional Layer**: Applies convolution operations using kernels to extract features from the input image.
- **Pooling Layer**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, typically using max pooling or average pooling.
- **ReLU Layer**: Introduces non-linearity by applying the Rectified Linear Unit activation function.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: Connects neurons in one layer to all neurons in the next layer, enabling the network to learn complex representations.
- **Dropout Layer**: Prevents overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign). This dataset contains over 50,000 images of German traffic signs, categorized into 43 classes.

## Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing
- Images are normalized to ensure the pixel values are within a standard range.
- Data augmentation techniques are used to increase the diversity of the training dataset.

### Model Architecture
- The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and ReLU activations.
- A series of fully connected layers are added at the end, with a softmax activation function for the final classification.

### Training and Evaluation
- The model is trained using a categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
- Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss, with visualizations provided for better understanding.
